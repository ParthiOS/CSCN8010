# CSCN8010# California Housing Price Prediction ‚Äì Univariate Linear Regression

This project builds and evaluates three **univariate linear regression models** to predict **median house value** in California using demographic features from the 1990 census. The goal is to identify which feature is the best single predictor of housing prices, while also demonstrating sound machine learning practices.

## üìÅ Dataset

- Source: [California Housing Prices on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
- Format: CSV (`housing.csv`)
- Features used:
  - `median_income`
  - `population`
  - `households`
  - `median_house_value` (target)
 

Three linear regression models were run and the results plotted and interpreted. I encapsulated these results within a table and explained the result with a final summary.
